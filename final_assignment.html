			<h4>A Metrics-Based Analysis of The Frontier League’s Role in MLB Player Development

			<h3>What Is The Frontier League?</h3>

			<p>Every season, thousands of baseball prospects face the reality of struggling to find spots on the rosters of minor league affiliations. These players range from once highly touted draft picks with injury setbacks, to college players who never fully grasped the attention of Major League Baseball (MLB) scouts. </p>

<p>In 1993, the Frontier League was established, with a mission to provide a lifeline to these major league hopefuls. Since its inception, the league has positioned itself to be their home, providing a crucial pathway back into the game, with the hopes of facilitating contracts with MLB-affiliated teams. </p>

<p>In September 2020, MLB acknowledged the partnership by officially naming them as an “MLB Partner League”. With this partnership solidified the Frontier League has begun mirroring its operations with its MLB counterpart. </p> 

<p>The Frontier League has embraced this transformation aimed at better preparing its players for the standards of MLB while still enforcing its own regulations to preserve competitive integrity.

			<h3>Scouting & Salary Cap Restrictions</h3>
			<p>When it comes to scouting talent, Frontier League clubs must navigate through obstacles not encountered by MLB front offices. Teams must temper their pursuit of certain standout prospects with constraints forced by the league’s strict salary cap.</p>  

<p>The salary cap, a rule used in several major sports leagues restricts excessive spending and is a set maximum monetary amount that teams can spend on their entire payroll every season.</p>

<p>MLB stands as the lone of the “Four Major Sports” in the U.S. to not have a salary cap, alleviating financial pressure from MLB general managers </p>

<p>The Frontier League’s 2024 salary cap was set at $365,000, with each team’s highest-paid player being limited to $27,300 per season. These financial limitations force evaluators to make decisions about where to invest their limited resources.</p>

<p>Kevin Tuve, the head scout for the league’s New York Boulders, spoke about the salary cap and its restrictions on the Boulders’ transactions.</p>

<p>“The salary cap has to go up in our league, because it’s so strict we are really hamstrung on who we can bring in and how much experience [the player has],” Tuve said.</p>

<p>Tuve also discussed how the limitations require the club to create strategies to work around the financial parameters.  
</p>
<p>“There are some loopholes you have to work through…we have to look for younger talent,” Tuve mentioned.</p>

<p>One loophole revolves around the league’s lenient cap restrictions on players ages 23 and younger. These “rookies” are given an Experienced 1 Classification under league rules. Any such players on standard contracts only get 50% of their salary counted towards a team’s salary cap.<a href="https://www.frontierleague.com/information/Player_Eligibility/Player_Eligibility"> According to the league website, each team must have “A minimum of 6 players of Experienced-1 classification,”</a> but many teams such as the Boulders are looking to maximize this number to maintain sustainable cap health.</p>

<p>Given this strategic focus, organizations prioritize scouting prospects graduating from college, seeing them as cost-effective high-ceiling investments. Teams actively build connections with local college coaches inquiring about their players. To get a first-hand look at these players, teams hold tryouts giving their coaching staff the chance to evaluate each player and determine who fits within their system.</p>

<p>Without much-needed cap space adjustments, roster construction in the Frontier League may continue to be a challenge. With inflation increasing athletes’ contract values across sports leagues, other independent sports leagues such as the Federal Hockey League (FHL) and The Basketball League (TBL) have already increased their player wages. This begs the question of why hasn’t the Frontier League done the same.</p>

			<h3>Pitching Trends 

</h3>
			<p>Pitching trends in baseball are constantly evolving, shaped by analytics, organizations continuously look to refine their approach. In MLB, the latest phenomenon has been the rise in sinker usage league-wide.</p>

<p>In the late 2010s, the sinker slowly made its way back into MLB arsenals. In recent seasons, it has helped revitalize pitchers’ careers.</p>

<p>Major League pitching staffs as a whole have taken notice of this trend and have begun utilizing it to maximize their production.<a href="https://blogs.fangraphs.com/thinking-about-sinking/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"> According to Ben Clemens, of Fangraphs, the 2022 Philadelphia Phillies starting pitching staff threw the sinker almost 30% of the time that season, a league-high in that metric.</a></p>

<p>To align with the growing usage of the sinker at the MLB level, Frontier League staff have begun shifting their focus to being more sinker-heavy as well.</p>

<p>“There has to be a parallel between us and the Major Leagues I would say with that [sinker usage], I think there is a correlation with the sinker being used more,” Tuve said.</p>

<p>According to a dataset obtained from the New York Boulders baseball operations department, between the 2023-24 seasons, in Boulders home games the sinker saw a tremendous 500% increase. On the other hand, surprisingly enough, the fastball a pitch usually seen as a pitcher's best friend saw a dip during the 2024 season. Pitchers shielded away from the heater as it saw a 23% decrease in 2024.</p>

<p>Even though we saw a decline in fastball usage during the 2024 season, pitchers still relied on the fastballs as their "out pitch". In counts with two strikes, pitchers went to the fastball almost 50% of the time. Even with the surge in sinker usage, the sinker was trusted to get an out less than 5% of the time.</p>

<p>“I don’t think Frontier League pitchers trust it [sinker] nearly enough,” Tuve stated.</p>

<p>Despite sinker usage being on the rise across the sport, pitchers have remained cautious. They have refused to throw it against opposite-handiness batters,<a href="https://www.mlb.com/news/splitters-and-sinkers-becoming-more-popular-pitches"> resulting in the 2023 season being the first season in over a decade that the sinker resulted in a positive run value for pitchers, noted by MLB.com’s Mike Petriello.</a>

			<h3>Scouting Reports
</h3>
			<p>To combat the constant pitching developments in the sport, batters are always searching for their way to level the playing field. Thus, hitters heavily rely on scouting reports provided to them by their analytics staffs.</p> 

<p>These scouting reports give the hitters a full data-driven profile of the pitchers they will face in their upcoming games, however, data has found that these reports are more effective later in the season compared to the first couple of months.</p>

<p>New York Boulders hitting coach TJ Zarewicz discussed the importance of scouting reports when it comes to preparing his hitters.</p>

<p>“Hitters are always looking for the next advantage, it’s just forward-thinking,” Zarewicz said.</p> 

<p>The Boulders dataset showed that pitchers were more comfortable throwing their off-speed pitches at a higher rate and balancing their selection amongst all their pitches early in the season. But as scouting reports developed and teams started picking up on tendencies, pitchers became more one-sided as the fastball saw an almost 40% increase and teams saw diverse arsenals as too risky further into the season.</p>

<p>Despite detailed reports being available in MLB, pitchers aren’t too worried about them, all due to the sheer talent of the league’s arms.</p>

<p>“The best guys are going to pitch to their strengths,” Zurewitz noted. “They aren’t going to be worried about it at all.”</p>

			<h3>Preparation For the Major Leagues

The advancements in scouting and in-game analytics have made the league a great spot for struggling prospects to grab the attention of MLB scouts. It will continue playing a pivotal role in MLB player development for years to come.
